{: .battle-title }

The four legged enemies accelerate quickly and are difficult to dodge. It's helpful to slash them to start a battle with initiative. You get 1000ep and can run away immediately, and after the battle there is a short period time where enemies won't see you.

enemy shields reset every time they attack. When you go for knockdowns its best to start them right after they attack, which gives you the largest window of time

After collecting the item after the crawlspace, you need to pay attention to the large enemy. when he is moving to the left, pass by the right side of him. then just take a straight line to the last item.

the middle character is important, because they go first when you start a battle with initiative.

### First Lantern
When you load a save file, you get a short period of time where enemies can't see you. We're going to abuse this to walk past the enemy guarding the first lantern

stand just outside of the red enemy circle, close to the barrel
line up in this direction (when you load your save, the camera will face where ao is facing)

<img src="54e0269d94b6b2ff034a995f139ca432.png" width=600>

save, and load this save file again
hold forward
you should run straight through undetected

notes:
- Now that we have the sunflower bed, infights are no longer the best strategy.
- The party is fast enough that you can quickly build up a damage multiplier, and 3 characters simultaneously attacking with this multiplier adds up to a lot of damage. 
- During battles the goal is to knock down the enemy, but not break the last barrier. This avoids the infight cutscene which saves time, but also builds up ether for a second wave of attacks that will either kill, or knock down again.
