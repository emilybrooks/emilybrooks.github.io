## General Notes:
- In battle, when selecting your command you can press cancel to move the cursor to attack

- Do not check the fridge unless it's the date specified. It messes up the schedule for reasons

- When you need to get to a location on the overworld, the notes list the option you should select from the warp menu (X, or triangle on a ps4 controller). Navigating like this is usually faster, especially since pc version speedruns remove load times.

## Dungeon Navigation Basics
- Most of the floors are randomly generated, but a few have a set layout. Usually these ones have a cutscene trigger or a miniboss fight. The notes show a screenshot of the map for these floors

- Don't bother with chests. You can get fights from opening a chest which is slow, and the items you would recieve are unnecessary. All of the good equipment has rng manips later in the run.

- For the majority of the run (except for the beginning when you need personas from shuffle times) you will not want to fight enemies.

todo:
I came across this image gallery of screenshots for figuring out which doors are the ones that lead to stairs, I still need to take better screenshots and put them in the relevant part of the notes.

### Yukiko's Castle Part 1

Note: To get player advantage, attack the enemy from behind

Fight first enemy:
Yu tactics > yosuke > direct commands
Lying Hablerie zio
Calm Pesce garu

Notes:
- From the first shuffle time you want pixie, grab slime if you get it instead though.
- The goal is to have both pixie and slime, but sometimes the game is mean about giving you both of them.
- You absolutely need pixie before leaving the dungeon today, so fight additional enemies to get it if needed.
- Ukobach, angel, and apsaras are helpful but you can fuse them later.

Note: As far as I can tell the only consistent way to get shuffle times is to end a fight with an all out attack. On easy, you deal too much damage and kill the enemies in one hit

If you need to do additional fights:
menu > system > change difficulty > damage given
- Set to normal
- Press B, then A to commit the change

After getting pixie, move up to 2F
Note: When you find the exit, you can press X to open the warp menu and select "move on to next floor" to save time

Before entering the boss fight:
- Set damage back to "great"
- Heal with yosuke's dia
- Yosuke needs 20 sp
- Yu needs 12 sp for rakunda

### Yukiko's Castle Part 2

Enter the dungeon
Open the navigator menu
- change battle tactics
- chie
- direct commands

Note: You need to have slime if you didn't get it before, so fight enemies (you might have to change the damage back to small. now that chie's in the party an all out attack should kill even on small damage)

Note: If you see any golds on the way to floor 5, you can potentially fight them. You need to be careful that you don't have another enemy chasing you, or it will lead to a follow up encounter. If you run away during a follow up encounter you won't get the first fight's exp.

### Yukiko's Castle, 5F
Gold Hand Manip:
- use a goho-m
- return to the entrance
- save
- close the game (alt f4 to skip the confirmation prompt)
- open the game
- load your save file
- enter the dungeon at 5F

Walk forward, there will be a gold hand

Notes:
- Gold hands can be particularly tricky. You want to approach while it's facing the wall or away from you.
- You don't have that much room to chase after it because of the warp, but if you do hit the warp you can turn around and catch up with it.
- Fight the gold hands using ice cubes
- One fight should bring yu to level 10, if not repeat the previous steps

Enter the dungeon
Set kanji to direct commands

When opening a door at the end of a hallway, look at the floor texture. You can tell if it leads to a treasure room if the pink glow is missing. Use this to avoid going to treasure rooms

Another clue to look at is the design on the wall
for marukyu striptease
- when both rise's silhouettes face each other, it leads to stairs
- when they face away from each other, it leads to a treasure room

Note: Don't waste time fighting golden hands in this dungeon

Catch river guardian
- Use the inaba jewel beetle as bait

How to fish:
- For the guardians, when you first cast the line you can tell if the fish is the guardian if a large splash surrounds the hook.
- Pull back when the lure sinks instead of bobbing
- Use the left analog stick to move the cursor to the center part of the bar, and then hold A to reel it in
- Fish aggressively, the line has more health than you think it has. If you are too cautious the fish will move away from you, and it's better to rush through and damage your line than have the fish swim away and undoing your progress.

### Izanami-no-Okami
8500HP Level 90
Phys ー / Fire ー / Ice ー / Elec Drn. / Wind ー / Light Null / Dark Null

--------------------------------------------------
Notes:
- Physical damage is reduced by 50%
- Leave teddie dead, buffs/debuffs are bad for this fight because the boss can use dekunda. I think the boss will behave more aggressively if debuffed but I'm not 100% sure.

Yu switch to hachiman, agidyne
Chie god's hand
Yukiko heal/burning petals
Teddie guard

If you see mind charge, guard
- This prevents you from getting a status ailment, which leads to an instant kill

Finish with Myriad Truths
