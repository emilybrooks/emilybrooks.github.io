# Final Fantasy 7 Any% No Slots Notes

Disclaimer: I didn't make these notes to be very fast. Personally I had zero interest in manipulating the step counter or getting super optimized with the battle menuing in order to make some of the riskier strats work. I prioritized consistency and ease of execution for all of the challenging fights. I also left out all the "paralyze dodge" stuff because the risk of soft locking didn't sound appealing. Yuffie is an incredibly slow character because of all the added cutscenes but I kinda just routed her in for fun. 

## General Notes:

- Soft reset: L1 L2 R1 R2 Start Select (it doesn't seem to work in battle for some reason)

- You should have fast disc speed turned on in the ps2 bios, it resets every time you turn the system off

## Manipulating ATB:

- When ATB is set to wait, you can pause both the player and enemy ATB gauges by opening a menu

- Normally, ATB gauges fill during the first part of attack animations.

- However, when you have all your moves queued and are waiting for them to play out, your ATB meters are paused and won't refill.

- The idea is to input your move, and have another party member open a menu, pausing the enemy's ATB gauge while the battle queue runs through.

- When there's nothing left in the battle queue, you can close the menu to resume ATB, and repeat.

- This process significantly slows down the enemies' attacks, and is necessary to get through difficult fights like demon's gate. 

# Disc 1

Timing starts when you select NEW GAME

## Reactor 1

## Shinra Building

Config:

		ATB Wait

Order:

		Cloud back
		Tifa back
		Barret back


Notes:
- Party members in the back row receive half the damage from physical attacks, and deal half damage with physical attacks.

- Certain characters are "long range" (barret, yuffie, and vincent). They do not have their physical attacks reduced in the back row.

- Because everyone's throwing grenades for the near future, and grenades aren't physical attacks, we put everyone in the back row for free damage reduction.

- Equipping a character with the long range materia removes the damage reduction on close range characters in the back row. 

Go to the left to take the stairs

You have to select the waterpolo, not the character trapped by it.

Resume throwing grenades to finish the fight

Notes:
- If bottomswell doesn't get poisoned for 5+ turns use potions to heal
- You can pay attention to bottomswell's animation to know when he switches to his second and third phase
- Water polo happens at the start of the third phase
- You can press select during battles to see enemy names when you're targeting attacks if you're having trouble selecting the water polo.

Marching minigame:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFAzMuiLEd0>

- When the commander says "charge", hold down and cross. you will bump into the guards and then continue running when they walk past you

- When you get stopped a second time, stand still, and wait for the guards in the back row to catch up

- After the guards in the back row catch up to you, hold left to keep marching. You need to be lined up with them or you won't be able to get any points

- Mash circle pretty fast. you get 3% every time you close a text box

Ideally you should get 50% approval rating to get 5000 gil

It's not the end of the world if you get between 40-49%, as you get 6 ethers instead which you can sell for 4500 gil

Otherwise reload your save and try again, as you won't have enough money to get into the gold saucer later. This is probably the fastest way to get the money.

Rufus cutscene

Go to the door next to the alleyway

- You're trying to get the force stealer, which is the reward for 100+ points.

Materia:
Cloud:

		Weapon:

Tifa:

		Weapon:
		Replace Fire with Steal

Notes:
- The steal materia gives tifa +2 dexterity, which increases her chances of landing a deathblow. Deathblow divides "atk%" by three, so any boost is helpful. Dexterity also makes your atb gauge fill slightly faster.

- The shiva materia causes cloud to take more damage, meaning his limit will charge faster.

- Characters with sadness take 1/3rd less damage, but charge their limit breaks at a slower rate

- Characters with fury take more damage, but charge their limit faster

Go below deck

Note: If there's a bullmotor in the back, you can kill it with a molotov+grenade

Note: When learning enemy skills, you must win the fight in order to learn the skill

Note: Laser is basically gravity. It does half of the target's current hp in damage, which is useful on some fights and also for getting tifa into critical hp without killing her.

Stall ATB with every turn

Heal with hi-potions (i'm unsure if you have any from enemy drops here)

Cait Sith big guard
Tifa transform > mini on herself

Keep casting mini until it's successful

Cloud bio materia keeper.

If materia keeper was not poisoned, use a potion on him and try to bio again.

After poison:
The goal is to deal exactly 99 damage ignoring poison ticks
Whatever damage cloud did, tifa needs to make up the rest of it.
Tifa can do 1 damage with a normal attack while mini
You can also use death sentence on her to do 4 damage

Notes:
- Big Guard casts haste, barrier, and magic barrier on everyone in the party. Most of the time it's used for haste to effectively slow the enemies down by letting you attack faster.

- Poison should do 262 damage each tick. After two ticks it will do 524. adding the 99 damage brings it to 623. Materia keeper's hp is 8400, which subtracting 623 equals 7777

- When a player (or enemy) is at 7777 hp, every attack they do will deal 7777 damage. However, poison will also inflict 7777 damage. So materia keeper will die at the next tick of poison damage.

### Red Dragon
6800HP Lv. 39 

Cloud Force Stealer, Silver Armlet
Aerith Guard Stick, Edincoat, Fire Ring
Tifa Powersoul, Silver Armlet, Fury Ring

--------------------------------------------------
Stall ATB with every turn

Big guard
Death sentence tifa

If the cloud or aerith get attacked heal them with a hi potion

Get tifa into critical hp:
- Molotov does 330ish damage
- Grenade does 140ish damage
- Laser does half the current hp in damage. 

If cloud still has his limit he can use cross slash here to paralyze red dragon. 

When tifa's in critical:
Aqualung
Wait for tifa's atb to fill up
Pause atb
Wait for the attack animations to finish
Unpause atb

Repeat until you finish the fight

Notes:
- Death sentence ticks down at the same speed on both fast and slow battle speeds. so by having our battle speed set to fast, we can maximize the time spent with death sentence before it kills tifa.

- The fury ring puts tifa into berserk, where she will automatically do physical attacks and have a x1.5 damage multiplier. Death sentence gives a 4x multiplier, and being in critical health with the powersoul gives an x2 damage modifier. 1.5 * 4 * 2 = x12 damage.

10,000HP Lv. 45

Cloud Force Stealer, Dragon Armlet
Aerith Guard Stick, Edincoat, Fire Ring
Tifa Powersoul, Silver Armlet, Fury Ring

--------------------------------------------------
Stall ATB with every turn

Big guard
Spider web
Death sentence tifa

Note: If he casts petrify use a soft to get rid of it.

If tifa dies:
(have both cloud and aerith's turns ready)
first turn phoenix down and hi potion
second turn big guard and death sentence

Before demon rush:
Keep aerith and cloud at full health with hi potions
Tifa should be at least above 400hp

Keep stalling atb after tifa's turn is ready

After demon rush:
Get tifa into critical
Continue atb stalling while tifa attacks

Notes:
- After demon's gate hp is less than 25%, 50%, or 75% of his max hp, he will begin preparing for demon rush. It's random how many turns he will stall for. We're doing so much damage he's basically guaranteed to queue up a second demon rush right after the first. The goal of the fight is to kill him before he can use it again.

- The spider web casts slow on demon's gate. This lets you rack up more damage before he uses demon's rush, meaning it's more likely you can kill him before he gets a second demon rush.

Tifa hero drink herself

Cloud and Yuffie: 4 magic hammers on schizo left (check it's name with select)
Tifa hi-potions if needed

After 4 magic hammers:
Death sentence tifa
Tifa death blow right head

When you kill schizo right, He will use a powerful lightning spell. Yuffie needs to survive this so she should have full health, but tifa is going to die so we can revive her with critical hp

After schizo right is dead:
Yuffie revive tifa
Yuffie death sentence tifa
Tifa deathblows
Yuffie hi-potion to full hp

Notes:
- Schizo left uses ice, schizo right uses fire

- We want to drain schizo left's mp because our equipment makes fire damage trivial, but ice is still dangerous

- Schizo right counters with quake2 after you hit it 5 times. schizo right counters after you hit it 6 times

- Powersoul is x2 damage, deathblow is x2 damage, death sentence is x4 damage. 2 * 2 * 4 = x16 damage. Plus an attack with x8 damage from added cut.

- The hero drink gives a 1.3x multiplier to atk, def, vitality, and spirit stats. I don't know if there's a better fight to use this on

- On death, schizo counters with a powerful lightning move. Tifa and cloud should die, but yuffie should survive.

### Safer∙Sephiroth

--------------------------------------------------

During sephiroth's intro animation thing that pauses atb:
Tifa deathblow
Yuffie debarrier
Cloud big guard (hold atb until deathblow and debarrier are done)

Tifa deathblow
Yuffie 2x-cut
Cloud stall atb

After shadow flare:
If tifa dies:

	Yuffie phoenix down
	Cloud big guard
	Yuffie 2x-cut
	Tifa deathblow
	Cloud vaccine tifa (hold atb with this until deathblow and 2x-cut are done)

If yuffie dies:

	Cloud phoenix down
	Tifa deathblow
	Yuffie 2x-cut
	Cloud vaccine tifa (hold atb with this until deathblow and 2x-cut are done)

If cloud dies (this likely won't happen):

	Yuffie phoenix down
	Cloud will probably die to the physical attack, if not have him vaccine tifa

Continue 2x-cut and deathblow

Supernova:
- This deals 15/16ths of your current health, it will not kill.
- This has a random chance of confusing a party member. You do not want tifa to be confused.
- If tifa died before (the vaccine loses effect) you could just kill her and revive to get rid of confuse.

Afterwards if safer sephiroth has less than 25% health, he will only use heartless angel, which sets your hp to 1 and can't kill.

You should be able to kill him before the cycle repeats. 

Note: I don't think kill+revive works to fix frog, so use the remedy on that.
