# Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon: Another Story Any%

## This is a work in progress, I'm just putting it up now so I can collaborate with other people's routes

## General Notes
- This guide is based off the [2019 fan translation](http://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=28632.0). The translation is pretty awful, so if you're comfortable playing games in Japanese I'd recommend that instead.

eudial:
t1:
mars: defend
mercury: bubble spray
saturn: defend
neptune: defend
chibi: manicure saturn

if mercury dies:
- mars toilette
- chibi lifesyrup

t2
chibi: defend
mercury: defend
saturn: death reborn revolution

the following fights follow the same pattern, mercury bubble spray to nerf the enemies attack, chibi manicure saturn, and saturn death reborn revolution. she should be bulky enough to survive without healing. use all cures to get rid of status effects, toilettes are a full party heal in a pinch.

after the 5 fights, go up to the castle to fight anshar

venus > moon
pluto > moon
saturn > moon

mercury > chibi
mars > chibi
uranus > chibi
neptune > chibi

accessories:

		swap red pupil with amulet
		swap red pupil with bracelet

jupiter:

		swap bracelet with red pupil
		swap bracelet with red pupil

formation:

venus   pluto
   jupiter
saturn   moon

go through the tower of time the same way you did before
- remember to pause skip

todo: probably have venus and saturn defend cause they barely do any damage

apsu:
t1
venus: defend
pluto: time stop
jupiter: defend
saturn: perfume
moon: healing shower

t2
venus: venus wink chain
pluto: cologne
jupiter: sparkling wide pressure

![dfc02c2a7827302989eedfa5ed5e93c4.png](resources/0b5c654a6e914d45be0bffb5d68eff49.png)

team: jupiter, venus, pluto, uranus

formation:

venus   pluto
   jupiter
uranus   moon

todo: why does venus still have the topaz tiara?
todo: i might just not have the others attack because it's probably slower than only having jupiter attack

god of ruin:
t1
venus: defend
pluto: timestop
jupiter: defend
uranus: defend
moon: healing shower

t2
venus: healing shower
pluto: cologne
jupiter: sparkling wide pressure
uranus: space sword buster
moon: perfume

rest of fight
venus: venus wink chain sword
pluto: timestop/cologne
jupiter: sparkling wide pressure
uranus: space sword buster
moon: defend




opposito: highest defense is 70
- sin has 44000 health
- if you take venus with them, you can use healing shower to boost attack a little bit
possible aoe specials:
- mars burning mandala
- uranus world shaking

saturn does 5600 on sin
venus does 3800 on sin
so 9400 per round
which will take 5 rounds

jupiter does 9999
venus does 3800
uranus does 3000
which will take 3 rounds lol

without a red pupil equipped, jupiter does 7000

crystal tokyo: highest defense is 75
- anshar has 35000 health
- jupiter does 4300
- which will take 9 rounds
- saturn with 2 red pupils does 4200

so tldr it's way better to have jupiter fight the opposito with no red pupils equipped, and to have saturn go to crystal tokyo with both red pupils

after anshar you would probably add saturn to your team so you can yoink the equips off her
